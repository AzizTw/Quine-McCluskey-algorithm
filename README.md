# Quine-McCluskey algorithm
Python implementation of [Quine–McCluskey algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm) to find:  
* The Prime Implicants  
* The Essential Prime Implicants  
* All minimum sum of products forms    
<br>

## Up to 26 variables
_For any given function._
<br>

## How to use  
You can choose whether you want to run it interactively or not.  

To use the interactive mode, you should run the following command:
```python main.py -i```  
  
For non-interactive use, you should run ```python main.py``` and specify the number of variables in the first argument, and then your minterms, and finally, the dont-cares which are optional.  

For example: 
```python main.py 4 0 1 2 3 4 -d 5 6 7 8```  
**4** is the number of variables, the minterms are **{0,1,2,3,4}**, and the dont-cares are **{5,6,7,8}**.

## Sample runs
```python main.py -i```: 

![](/imgs/Sample.jpg "Sample Run1")  
  
```python main.py 4 0 1 2 3 4 -d 8 9 10 11```:  

![](/imgs/Sample2.jpg "Sample Run2")  

```python main.py 3 0 4 2 6 7```:  

![](/imgs/Sample3.jpg "Sample Run3")
