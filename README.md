# Quine-McCluskey algorithm
Python implementation of Quine–McCluskey algorithm to find:  
* The Prime Implicants  
* The Essential Prime Implicants  
* All minimum sums of products forms  
  
<br>

## Up to 26 variables
_For any given function._

<br>

## How to use
1- Enter the number of variables of your K-Map  
2- Enter the minterms' indices  
3- Enter the don't cares, if any. else just insert a new line (Press Enter)
